Jenny has written a function that returns a greeting for a user. However, she's in love with Johnny, and would like to greet him slightly different. She added a special case to her function, but she made a mistake.

Can you help her?

/* 

export function greet(name:string): string {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
  if(name === "Johnny")
    return "Hello, my love!";
}


*/

export function greet(name: string): string {
  if (name === 'Johnny') return 'Hello, my love!';
  return 'Hello, ' + name + '!';
}
